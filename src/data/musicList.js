I don’t know why
Sometimes I drift away
And there are times
It hurts too much to pray
But You reach out Your hand
And You call me by name
You wrap me in Your arms
And You love me just the same

[Chorus]
‘Cause I am Yours
And even when I fall
You call me Yours
And hold me through it all
You lift my head
Said I'm worth dying for
You tell me who I am
That I am Yours

[Verse 2]
I don’t know why
I listen to the noise
And there are times
When I can’t hear Your voice
But I know You won’t leave
You have called me by name
Your love has rescued me
I’ll never be the same

[Chorus]
‘Cause I am Yours
And even when I fall
You call me Yours
And hold me through it all
You lift my head
Said I'm worth dying for
You tell me who I am
That I am Yours

[Bridge]
So when all I do
Feels like it’s not enough
Take me to the cross
Where You poured out Your love
When I doubt myself
Remind me of this truth
That all that matters
Is that I’m found in You

[Chorus]
‘Cause I am Yours
And even when I fall
You call me Yours
And hold me through it all
You lift my head
Said I'm worth dying for
You tell me who I am…

[Chorus]
‘Cause I am Yours
And even when I fall
You call me Yours
And hold me through it all
You lift my head
Said I'm worth dying for
You tell me who I am

[Outro]
Remind me, Oh God
That I am Yours
Forever Yours
My Jesus
Remind me, Oh God
That I am Yours
Forever Yours

 So great His love, it drove Him to the cross
 He gave His life to redeem every sinner
 Claimed for His own those who once were lost

You wrote the story of love 
By Your scars
One act of grace, 
so full of glory
You wrote the song of love 
In my heart
And now I’ll sing, 
For all eternity
I’m clothed in You,
and You live in me
In Your presence, 
only joy and peace
In Your story of love
 
[Verse 2]
Even from the beginning,
You knew what it would cost
Somehow You said I was worth the pain
You took all of my sin
And nailed it to the cross
The perfect Lamb of God now slain
Your justice and mercy
Satisfied and fully free
 
[Chorus]
You wrote the story of love 
By Your scars
One act of grace, 
so full of glory
You wrote the song of love 
In my heart
And now I’ll sing, 
For all eternity
I’m clothed in You,
and You live in me
In Your presence, 
only joy and peace
In Your story of love
 
[Bridge]
No greater love I know
Than the love You show
A love that does not fade
No greater love exists
Than a love like this
That Your own life You gave
And with passion untamed
 
[Chorus]
You wrote the story of love 
By Your scars
One act of grace, 
so full of glory
You wrote the song of love 
In my heart
And now I’ll sing, 
For all eternity
I’m clothed in You,
and You live in me
In Your presence, 
only joy and peace

[Chorus]
You wrote the story of love 
By Your scars
One act of grace, 
so full of glory
You wrote the song of love 
In my heart
And now I’ll sing, 
For all eternity
I’m clothed in You,
and You live in me
In Your presence, 
only joy and peace
In Your story of love

[Tag]
You've claimed my heart
For all eternity
So now I sing
Your story of love`,

    lyrics: `[Verse 1]
“Who am I? Is there purpose for my life?”
These are the questions, that every heart cries
All alone, you’ve been striving on your own
You’re lost in the darkness, afraid of the light
You’re not hidden from My eyes
Let My truth silence the lies

[Chorus]
Come to Me
I know you’re weary
So let Me give rest to your soul
Come to Me
Call on My mercy
Let My sacrifice make you whole
You don’t have to be afraid
The price is already paid
And I’m longing to set you free
So come to Me

[Verse 2]
Dead in sin, that’s where your story begins
But I had a plan, for you even then
Crucified, I died to give you new life
And I would do it, all over again
For My blood will wash you clean
Hear My call and just believe

[Chorus]
Come to Me
I know you’re weary
So let Me give rest to your soul
Come to Me
Call on My mercy
Let My sacrifice make you whole
You don’t have to be afraid
The price is already paid
And I’m longing to set you free
So come to Me

[Bridge]
My arms are open wide
See the nail scars in My hands
All for love I died
So that you could understand
I have borne all your shame
And I call you by name

[Chorus]
Come to Me
I know you’re weary
So let Me give rest to your soul
Come to Me
Call on My mercy
Let My sacrifice make you whole
You don’t have to be afraid
The price is already paid
And I’m longing to set you free...

[Chorus]
Come to Me
I know you’re weary
So let Me give rest to your soul
Come to Me
Call on My mercy
Let My sacrifice make you whole
You don’t have to be afraid
The price is already paid
And I’m longing to set you free
So come to Me

[Tag]
Don’t you see
You can lay those burdens down
I’m where true life is found
So come to Me`,

    lyrics: `[Verse 1]
When there's no one who's watching
And my purpose feels empty
God, I know
You're still here with me
When my impact seems so small,
And I doubt the point of it all
God, You alone
give me faith to believe
You are the strength of my heart
Because I know who You are

[Chorus]
The God who sees
The God who hears
Who holds me close
And bottles my tears
The God who breathes
The God who knows
Who counts the cost
And calls me faithful
No matter how things seem
I am never unseen

[Verse 2]
When it takes all that I have
And I'm left with empty hands
God, I know.
You are still working
When everything I have done
Feels like a song left unsung
God, You alone
hear my heart's melody
And so nothing is in vain
Because I know that You remain

[Chorus]
The God who sees
The God who hears
Who holds me close
And bottles my tears
The God who breathes
The God who knows
Who counts the cost
And calls me faithful
No matter how things seem
I am never unseen

[Bridge]
Even the darkness is as light to Your eyes
I know Your ears are attentive to my cries
You search my heart and know all of my ways
With understanding, You have numbered my days
Oh, let me see
Your thoughts of me

[Chorus]
You're the The God who sees
The God who hears
Who holds me close
And bottles my tears
The God who breathes
The God who knows
Who counts the cost
And calls me faithful
No matter how things seem

[Chorus]
You're the The God who sees
The God who hears
Who holds me close
And bottles my tears
The God who breathes
The God who knows
Who counts the cost
And calls me faithful
No matter how things seem
I am never unseen

[Outro]
Oh, El Roi
You are the God who sees
I am never unseen`,

My beloved is a dove
In the clefts of the rock
There she finds her refuge
In the shadow of the cross
I hold her by the hand
And draw her ever near
My grace is where she stands
As I call for all to hear

[Chorus]
Arise now, my love
My lovely one, come
Come away with Me
Let Me set you free
Open your eyes now
See your past undone
And here in My arms
Find who you’ve become
My beloved bride…
Arise

[Verse 2]
My beloved is a fountain
A never ending spring
Drawn from the waters of life
She is washed and made clean
I claim her as My own
I have set her apart
She’s purchased by My blood
This is the cry of My heart

[Chorus]
Arise now, my love
My lovely one, come
Come away with Me
Let Me set you free
Open your eyes now
See your past undone
And here in My arms
Find who you’ve become
My beloved bride…
Arise

Let me hear your voice
Let me see your face
You are my delight
My chosen dwelling place
You have captured me
I am yours eternally

Arise now, my love
My lovely one, come
Come away with Me
Let Me set you free
Open your eyes now
See your past undone
And here in My arms
Find who you’ve become
My beloved bride…

Arise now, my love
