    lyrics: `Verse 1:
Lost in the melody
Of you and me
Every heartbeat
Echoes Your name
I wait for You
Are You longing too
All I am
Is Yours to claim

Chorus:
God, come for me
You're where I belong
You’re my symphony
That one perfect song
Lord, Your voice is
The rhythm of my heart
And my home is
Found in Your arms
God, come for me

Verse 2:
Forever with You
Can't come too soon
My heart aching
For the warmth of Your touch
Tears fall again
Every now and then
Am I wrong for
Wanting this so much

Chorus:
God, come for me
You're where I belong
You’re my symphony
That one perfect song
Lord, Your voice is
The rhythm of my heart
And my home is
Found in Your arms
God, come for me

Bridge:
I wait in the stillness
To hear You calling me
I ache for Your presence
And the day my eyes will see
The fullness of Your grace
The glory of Your face
Oh, Jesus

Chorus:
God, come for me
You're where I belong
You’re my symphony
That one perfect song
Lord, Your voice is
The rhythm of my heart
And my home is
Found in Your arms

Chorus:
God, come for me
You're where I belong
You’re my symphony
That one perfect song
Lord, Your voice is
The rhythm of my heart
And my home is
Found in Your arms
God, come for me

Outro:
Want to be with You
God come for me
I want to be with You
God come for me`,
